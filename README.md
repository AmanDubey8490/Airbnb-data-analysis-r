# Airbnb Listings Data Analysis (R)

## 📌 Project Overview

- Records: ~270K listings
- Features include price, room type, neighbourhood, reviews, and host attributes

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Price distribution analysis
- Impact of review scores on pricing
- Superhost vs non-superhost price comparison
- Top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods

## 📊 Visualizations
